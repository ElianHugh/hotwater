# TODO

## 1

- Cannot pass a plumber router to hotwater

## 2

- Updating CSS shouldn't typically cause a refresh

## 3

- Look at using NNG js side for more advances msg passing

## 4

- The CLI messages are a bit all over the place, and errors don't always cause the progress bar to fail

## 5

- An error doesn't always cause hotwater to attempt to restart. Should it? An error can indicate that the API has to be changed before trying again
